<h1>EVIL OUT OF ONZAR</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>By MARK GANES</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The orphan system of Onzar was fuming under its leader's driving,
paranoid megalomania. For there was a prize. A vast, grand prize
within a parsec of this ambitious domain&mdash;the major warp-lines of
space crossing the Galaxy between the Allied Worlds and the
Darzent Empire. Skyward, hungry legions!</i></p></div>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_r1.jpg" alt="R" width="40" height="50" /></div>
<p>oger Thane had, of course, heard
of these meetings. The stories of his
acquaintances in Liaison had been
graphic enough but they didn't begin to do
the scene justice. It was, well, jarring.</p>

<p>Through the one-way glass panel built
into one side of the vast meeting hall of the
space station, Thane looked directly across
at the delegation from Onzar, though "delegation"
was hardly the word. All top gold
from the Onzar group was there, and it was
easy to tell their rank&mdash;fleet marshals, the
technical advisors, the interpreters&mdash;by the
amount of gold that encrusted their helmets,
coruscated from their shoulder boards, and
crept and crawled in heavy filigree around
their uniforms. In that assembly it was easy
to pick out Candar. Shorter than the average
Onzarian, with shaven head, his uniform
was quite plain except for small, double-headed
platinum shagells on the collar.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image_002.jpg" width="500" height="497" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>And Candar was doing all the talking.
When he had started one hour and fifteen
minutes ago his voice had been harsh and
low. Now it had increased in pitch and volume
and he was striding back and forth,
showing his scorn for the Allied Systems in
every gesture. Thane glanced at the "absolute"
dial of his watch and wondered how
long it would keep up.</p>

<p>"... we have come to deal with you in
good faith and again you seek to exploit us.
You would, if you could, take all we produce
and give nothing in return. This you
shall not do. Onzar is young, but already
its power encompasses five suns. Each day
we grow stronger. We do not need your
shoddy goods in exchange for our treasure."</p>

<p>As Candar's voice became louder and
more shrill Thane noticed that a technician
to his left kept adjusting the recorder dials.
In an hour or so the speech would be broadcast
through Onzar, three and a half light
years from this meeting place in space.
Candar was choosing words to inflame the
already fanatical nationalism of his expanding
system. "You would take our discoveries,
the fruits of our genius and industry.
You would even take our young men into
slavery. But this Candar will prevent. We
are a warrior race, and what we need, we
take. Our day approaches."</p>

<p>The last three words were his trademark,
his invariable sign-off. So that was that.
Candar strode from the room followed by
the marshals, the advisors, the interpreters.
Thane looked over to Garth who had
slumped a bit in his conference chair on the
Allied Systems side of the room, and was
lighting a cigar. Thane had never particularly
liked Garth, but, now, he felt a touch
of sympathy with him. Garth took two long
puffs on his cigar and then slowly shrugged
his shoulders as if to put a final period to
the scene.</p>

<p>Back in the Allied Systems naval cruiser,
Garth was getting out of his reserve marshal's
uniform. He glanced across at Thane,
strapping his couch belts at the other side
of the compartment. "I wanted you to see
Candar in operation. Figured you might as
well as long as this show was scheduled
anyway. Could be that it will be of use to
you in your new assignment."</p>

<p>The navigator's voice came over the intercom,
"Prepare for finite acceleration, twenty
seconds absolute."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_g.jpg" alt="G" width="33" height="40" /></div>
<p>arth zipped up his civilian coveralls
and dropped to the couch, slipping the
stub of his cigar into the converter tube.
"This conference was about like the rest. It
makes the sixth, now, that I've sat through
with Candar. You remember he was full of
cooperation right at the start while we were
renewing the gold-trade agreement. After
that was settled there was nothing more in
it for him except the chance to make another
speech."</p>

<p>Thane looked over at Garth. "I noticed
that. But why? There was certainly plenty
of gold splashed over everyone in the Onzar
delegation, but what is it that makes the
stuff so important to them?"</p>

<p>Garth looked over in surprise. "You don't
know? Well, of course you wouldn't. You've
been working on specialized stuff on the
other side of the Galaxy. I'll give you some
of the background on the way back to Liaison.
The sleep-trainer will fill in there."</p>

<p>Garth stopped. Everything stopped as the
acceleration began. Both of them were over-braced
for the acceleration was light and
even. It was only 5000 KM to the nearest
warp-line.</p>

<p>As acceleration slacked off for the five-minute
coast into the warp, Garth lit another
cigar and began. "Onzar was one of
those relatively distant systems which were
colonized back in the days when all they
had was the finite drive. Of course, it took
them a generation or so to get out there,
at just under the speed of light. And when
they got there, the best guess is that their
ship was too damaged for further flight.
Otherwise, considering the planet, they
wouldn't have stayed."</p>

<p>Thane flipped through a systems manual
to the geographical data for Onzar IV. He
readily agreed that they wouldn't have
stayed if it had been possible for them to
get away. Onzar IV was cold, bitterly cold.
Hurricane winds were common. The mountains
went up to forty and fifty kilometers,
and the land between them was largely barren
desert.</p>

<p>"They couldn't get back into space,"
Garth continued, "so they stayed in splendid
isolation for about 1500 years. Not another
ship touched the system till the warp-lines
were discovered."</p>

<p>Thane looked up. "I suppose they went
through the usual reversion of the orphan
systems?"</p>

<p>Garth grunted. "A lot worse than usual.
Of course, our version of their history is
largely guesswork because the Onzarians
have never allowed any research. But it's
clear that the immigration crew, or their
first-generation descendants, put on a very
effective little war between themselves. By
the time they were finished Onzar IV was
back in the age of ox-carts, without the ox."</p>

<p>The intercom sounded again. "Five seconds
to warp-line." There was a pause, then
the familiar shummer and they were on the
warp-line drive. As usual, the shummer had
put out Garth's cigar. He re-lit it and went
on. "When we began using warp-line travel
we hit Onzar in the first fifty years of exploration.
Practically had to. It's only a parsec
from the confluence of nine lines running
between our part of the Galaxy and the
Darzent Empire. Right on the main road,
right in the middle of the next war." He
stared in silence at Thane for a moment.
"That's one reason I've called you in on
this."</p>

<p>For most of the rest of the trip to Liaison,
Garth continued to explain the strange orphan
system of Onzar. In the religion, as
Garth described it, the whole priesthood was
female, and gold had magical value. All the
men wore gold, the amount strictly in line
with their rank. They despised the women
but were in superstitious dread of them
because only the church could sanctify and
give power to their gold symbols of rank.
At first, the men had lived in warring tribes,
the women in religious groups. They came
together each spring and fall for the ceremonies
of gold consecration.</p>

<p>Still, they did make considerable technical
progress, partially because of their interest
in mining. By the time the first warp-line
ship reached them, the Onzarians had the
internal combustion engine, nation-states,
mass production, planet-wide wars.</p>

<p>"Of course," Garth went on, "in the early
days of warp-line exploration we weren't
as careful as we are now. The Onzarians
picked up enough to put on a real atomic
war within fifty years. After that they expanded
through their own system, and even
took over nearby suns. They certainly had
the motive for conquest, too. Gold was
running out on their own planet, and they'd
go to any lengths to get it."</p>

<p>Thane glanced at his watch and got back
onto his couch. "About time for deceleration,"
he said. Garth also began fastening
his straps. Thane glanced over, with curiosity.
"Sounds like the usual story, with
some interesting variations. Where do I
come in?"</p>

<p>"The thing that makes Onzar uniquely
important," Garth said, "is its position.
Space fleets from Darzent or from the A.S.
will have to pass within a parsec of Onzar,
because of the confluence of warp-lines in
that part of the system. Whoever controls
Onzar can win the war for the Galaxy when
it comes."</p>

<p>Garth paused as they went through the
shummer and the beginnings of deceleration,
and then went on. "We were doing
fairly well till Candar's revolt and seizure
of power. He is leaning toward Darzent.
Apparently he thinks he can keep his own
independence even if Darzent wins the decision.
He's going along with us just enough
to assure his supply of gold. But you noticed
his own lack of gold ornamentation. His
eventual aim is undoubtedly to dominate and
destroy the religion because it's about the
only independent force left on Onzar, and
Candar is not going to tolerate any independent
forces."</p>

<p>Garth looked steadily at Thane. "The
rest of the details, the language, and your
own mission will be made clear to you in
the sleep trainer. And it is no exaggeration
to say that you will be responsible for the
future of the Galaxy."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_l.jpg" alt="L" width="33" height="40" /></div>
<p>iaison Headquarters had started out
several centuries before as a small organization
within the Department of the
Outside, directly under the control of the
newly-formed Allied Systems Council. It
had begun in a room, and had later moved
to its own building. Now it occupied a
planet.</p>

<p>The four planets in the system all appeared
to be barren, lifeless rocks. Appearances
were correct for I, III, and IV. II,
however, was not what it seemed. Like the
others, the surface was rocky, barren, utterly
lifeless, without atmosphere. But a few kilometers
down, a red-haired boy had just won
a game of bok at school recess. A research
worker had just finished a report on an improved
interrogatory drug. An administrative
assistant had just planned a palace revolution
on a system 200 light years away.
And Roger Thane, Liaison Agent, was just
entering Medico-Synthesis, some eighteen
kilometers under the surface.</p>

<p>The young medic looked up as Thane
stepped off the mobiltrack and entered the
room. "You're Thane," he said, with curiosity
in his voice. "The instructions and the
sleep-record just came through the Pneum.
I've heard about you people from Proxima.
Just how does it work, anyway?"</p>

<p>Thane walked over to the sleep-table and
grinned a little wearily. "How are you able
to see?" he asked. "I don't know that I
could tell a blind man satisfactorily. How
do the people of the Noxus system telepath?
I don't know, and they've tried to tell me.
All I know is that mutations occurred sometime
while Proxima Centauri was an orphan
system, which enable many of us to make
small changes in our appearance. Hair color,
skin pigmentation, fingerprints. Usually
takes about two days. Liaison Research
learned how to speed it up with equipment
but they never have learned just what they're
working with." He smiled apologetically.
"I'm afraid that doesn't help you a bit but
there's nothing much more I can say that
will give you a clearer picture. I've tried
before."</p>

<p>Thane was then in his own normal: black
hair and eyes, somewhat over two meters in
height, with the heavily tanned Proxima
skin. Before sliding on the table he took a
sheet from the medic and glanced over his
new specifications: yellow eyes, golden hair,
golden skin. Slight slant to eyes. Three
centimeters height reduction. All routine
changes, and a matter of a few minutes, with
the aid of the Liaison equipment.</p>

<p>The medic was busy making connections,
giving injections and setting dials. Thane
looked up at the brightly lighted ceiling.
With no perceptible lapse he was still staring
at it when the medic began taking off
the connections. But in the zero subjective
time, the twelve minutes of elapsed time,
Thane had changed his appearance completely.
And what he had learned puzzled
him at first and then angered him.</p>

<p>"Roger Thane," the sleep-record began,
"your assignment is the protection of Dr.
Manning Reine...."</p>

<p>Reine, he learned, was one of the scientists
who had been working in obscure laboratories
on the Forsberg Project. Forsberg's
mathematics had shown the theoretical possibility
of a discreet jump, with no time
lapse, from one of the curving lines of
warp to the next, instead of the present
method of travel at "friction speed" along
the erratically curving lines.</p>

<p>Garth's voice cut in on the speech record.
"Now that we have the drive, what are we
going to do with it? Politically, the Allied
Systems cannot initiate the attack. Yet if we
merely wait, Darzent will eventually learn
the details of the drive. As it is, they outnumber
us, two to one. They have the advantage
in almost every respect. Their only
deterrent has been the fear that we do have
the second-stage drive.</p>

<p>"There have already been leaks&mdash;enough
so that if Manning Reine falls into Darzent
hands, they would have the drive in operation
within a few days. Then immediate attack,
and defeat. Your job is to protect
Reine, or to kill him if there is danger of
his loss to Darzent."</p>

<p>Manning Reine, a native of Onzar, had
been educated at the Systems University at
Beirut, Earth. He'd returned to Onzar but
had fled at the time of the Candar revolution.
On Earth, he'd married and gone on
with his research work. Now, after twenty-five
years, he was the key figure in the development
of the drive. Undoubtedly his
knowledge was enough to allow Darzent to
develop the drive if he should fall into
their hands. And he was not susceptible
to the protective, anti-interrogatory drugs.
Reine himself had developed the vitally
important gold catalyst principle.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_r.jpg" alt="R" width="35" height="40" /></div>
<p>eine's address was just a pair of top-secret
geographical coordinates, a thousand
kilometers from the nearest feeder jet-line.
Thane looked down at the endless Norwegian
forest, a thousand meters below his
rented anti-grav scout. He felt depressed.
That was always a reaction to be expected,
of course, after an accelerated identity
change. But then too, there'd been the
scene with Garth after he'd left Medico-Synthesis.</p>

<p>Thane had strode past Garth's secretary
and into the inner office without a word.
Garth was behind his desk, his back to the
door, studying a galactic wall map. He
turned slowly.</p>

<p>"A bodyguard!" Thane exclaimed. "Is
that your idea of the most responsible job
in the Galaxy? You pulled me off the Elron
business just when I was set to engineer the
beginnings of a representative government
there. The whole project will be set back
by years. And it was touch-and-go as it was.
And for what?"</p>

<p>Garth looked at him calmly for a moment,
as he bit off the end of a fresh cigar.
"Thane," he finally said, with deliberation,
"the executive council of the Department
of the Outside just doesn't like your methods.
You've put through some really brilliant
maneuvers but you've done it alone,
taking chances. I've tried to go along with
you but the last report from Elron caused
a real blow-up at the council. One of the
council members suggested your assignment
to this bodyguard job, as you call it, and
they all agreed. I had to go along."</p>

<p>"Just why, then, is all this Onzar background
necessary? Did you think it would
fool me?"</p>

<p>"I said I <i>had</i> to go along," Garth answered
impatiently, "but that's not all. I
also <i>wanted</i> to go along with the idea. This
is much more important than it appears
on the surface. We have reason to believe
that Reine is still connected with Onzar.
We don't have much to go on, but one of
your jobs will be to get the details."</p>

<p>The coordinates on the lat-don dial had
almost lined up, though the forest was still
completely unbroken below. A few hundred
meters to the right and he had it. Thane
let the anti-grav hover for a moment, and
then dropped silently downward. Branches
of spruce brushed against the plastic cabin
as the anti-grav settled into the forest. It
gently settled on a thin layer of powder
snow. There was nothing but the silence of
the forest, broken only by the thin sound of
the wind in the branches above.</p>

<p>He stepped out, breathing in the cold,
crisp air. He started off through the forest
using the unfamiliar Terran compass. One
hundred twenty meters, azimuth 273 (difficult
to maintain through the trees) and he
would come, according to his directions, to
a tree a little different from the rest. He
continued, with the brittle snow tinkling
faintly under his feet.</p>

<p>Then a new sound. Once ... again ...
then a repeated volley. Stoltz guns. From
the tone, hand size, tuned down below lethal
potential, but enough to stun and mutilate.</p>

<p>He was absolutely still for a moment.
Then he began running towards the sound,
trying to minimize the noise of crunching
snow under his feet.</p>

<p>He swerved to pass a clump of trees and
brush. As he did three things happened.
A small thrush started into the air off a
branch, fluttered a moment, then fell to the
snow. A white-clad figure appeared ahead,
just at the next bend. And.... Thane wondered
just what he was doing here ...
why wasn't he on Proxima? He remembered
school there ... what fun in elementary
atomics....</p>

<p>Then his training took over, forcing his
temporarily twisted brain to perform rationally.
As he dropped to the brittle snow and
aimed his own Stoltz, he automatically catalogued
his confusion as the result of an off-shot,
a near miss. He hit the snow. The
white figure was just off his sights, but
close enough. He pressed the impeller. That
one didn't miss, and it had been set on
"lethal." He crept forward across the
ground. He was sure that his immediate opponent
was through, but there were others.
The slithering Stoltz noises ahead increased
in volume.</p>

<p>He reached the white-cloaked figure. Onzarian.
The eyes and mouth had the idiot
expression peculiar to a Stoltz corpse. Thane
considered. He was at a disadvantage against
the snow in his blue civilian coveralls. He
quickly stripped the white cloak off the
corpse and put it on as he continued at a
run.</p>

<p>He slowed as he approached a clearing.
Not much of a clearing, not large enough
to be spotted from the air. Two figures in
the Patrol uniform were stretched out, motionless,
a few meters from the tree at the
center. Two men in white cloaks were carrying
a third figure between them, just entering
the pine forest at the further edge.
Thane instantly recognized the unconscious
figure as Reine. At once he started towards
them, shifting the Stoltz to the lightest stun
position. That cut the range way down, even
for this close-in weapon, but it would be
dangerous for Reine if he used more. Reine
apparently had had one dose already. On the
run, Thane aimed at one figure he had not
seen before. Apparently it was good, for
Thane was able to keep going. Fifteen meters
distant from the three figures, Thane
stopped. They were just visible through the
trees. He raised his Stoltz and ... thought
of Proxima....</p>

<p>... he was fifteen and the dance was
wonderful. She was dressed in the new
shell-white toga that was fashionable just
then. It certainly set off her jet-black hair,
shining on the terrace, in the light of Proxima's
two moons....</p>

<p>But it wasn't black, it was blonde. And
she wasn't leaning against his arm on the
terrace, she was standing in front of him,
and he was lying on the brittle snow. There
was a Stoltz in her bare right hand.</p>

<p>She stated at him, steadily and coldly. "It
is turned all the way up now. I hope you
are ready to die, Onzarian!"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>hane, as he recovered fully from the
Stoltz shock, recognized the tall blonde
girl standing before him. Astrid Reine,
Manning's daughter and assistant. He raised
himself painfully to his elbows. As he did,
he saw Astrid's knuckles tighten around
the impeller.</p>

<p>"No, Astrid," he said. "I'm here to help
you. We may still be able to save your
father."</p>

<p>Her hand didn't waver. The expression
on her golden face was scornful. "Do not
lie so childishly! You came with the Onzarians,
the agents of Candar. You are one
of them. You came to take my father."</p>

<p>Thane desperately gestured back the way
he had come. "My footprints are in the
snow. There's an Onzarian I killed. And
my anti-grav. I was sent to protect your
father."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>A roaring noise came from the east and
a moment later a jet cleared the tree tops,
headed south. Thane saw the ship at the
edge of his vision, but kept his eyes on
Astrid. She turned her head slightly at the
sound. Slightly, but enough. Thane's tensed
muscles contracted as he sprang to his feet.
She pressed the impeller&mdash;just as his left
foot kicked in a high arc and caught the
side of the barrel.</p>

<p>The gun spun off to the edge of the
clearing. "Now," he said angrily, "don't
you think we've wasted enough time? They
have him now, and with that jet they'll
have enough start on us to leave the system
before we can catch them." As he spoke,
the jet reappeared and slipped down low
over the trees to the west. "Hurry," he said,
"they'll be on us in seconds."</p>

<p>She looked at him, hesitated. Then, "All
right. Inside."</p>

<p>She stepped over to the trunk of the
tree and spoke softly. A panel opened in
the ground at the foot of the tree, over a
grav-well. They dropped gently, and the
panel closed behind them. As they floated
slowly downward they heard a sharp explosion
overhead. He smiled wryly at Astrid,
dropping beside him.</p>

<p>"Your change of heart," he said, "didn't
come any too soon."</p>

<p>Reine's laboratory, like a great deal else
in the Allied Systems, had gone underground
as galactic war approached. Far beneath
the surface, the grav-well ended in a
corridor, stretching out a hundred meters.
Rooms filled with equipment opened out at
either side. As they walked down the corridor,
Thane explained his mission and his
Onzarian appearance. "Now," he went on,
"there's a lot for me to catch up on."</p>

<p>"It's been terrible," Astrid said. "First,
there was the attack yesterday. We fought
them off, then. Liaison radioed that they
were sending more protection. But the jet
that landed today flashed the Liaison code
to our auto-interrogator. We lowered the
screen and they began to attack. We didn't
stand a chance, once they were inside."</p>

<p>It was all clear enough, and it was certainly
also clear that he was late. There
was the faint possibility that Reine could
still be rescued before the Onzarians could
leave the system.</p>

<p>He turned to Astrid. "If they plan to
leave by the regular Onzarian transport, we
should be able to catch them at the Aberdeen
spaceport. Where's the radio?"</p>

<p>They had reached an open door. Astrid's
gesture was hopeless. Thane looked inside.
The Onzarians had been there before they
left. Twisted, melted circuits were all they
had left.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>he anti-grav scout got them to the Aberdeen
spaceport an hour late. The Onzarian
gold transport had left for Kadell IV.
A few questions were enough to justify
Thane's growing pessimism. Several Onzarians
had taken passage. One was heavily
drugged, under the care of a physician.</p>

<p>The hours dragged till they were able to
get passage on the next Kadell-bound transport
the following day. Once spaceborne,
Thane felt a lot of his depression lift. There
was a good chance they would reach the
Kadenar spaceport on Kadell IV before the
other ship had left. In the meantime there
was Astrid....</p>

<p>By the time they had reached the second
warp-line intersection Thane had learned
that Astrid had also attended the Systems
University at Beirut, three classes behind
him. They'd had some of the same professors
and a couple of mutual friends. Thane
told her of life on Proxima, and she told
him how she had lived and worked with her
father. Her talk was in the off-hand sort of
vocal shorthand that their generation shared.
But through the facade, Thane could see
that she was immensely brilliant in research,
fascinated with her work, and at the same
time, immensely lonely. She was animated
when she spoke of the work that she and
her father had done but there was a different
sparkle in her yellow eyes when she
talked of the university. Talks with fellow
students, a brief love affair, weekend trips
to Tel Aviv or New Rome&mdash;it was plain
that she had badly missed it all in her years
in Norway, in the glittering, isolated laboratory
far under the snow.</p>

<p>And always there was recurrent alarm for
her father. She broke off her talk of the
University and gripped his arm. "Roger, we
must stop them. If they take my father to
Onzar, he'll be killed. And the movement.
What will happen to that?"</p>

<p>"The movement?" Roger Thane asked,
puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why of course," she said, surprised.
"Don't you know about it?"</p>

<p>Thane was about to answer, but just then
there was the shummer as they re-entered
space at the second warp-line intersection.
At the same moment the red warning light
in their compartment blinked. The navigator's
voice, with an undercurrent of alarm,
came over the intercom. "Emergency. Emergency!
Crew to battle stations. Passengers
to lifeboats."</p>

<p>Roger and Astrid dashed out into the
port corridor. The corridor widened as they
ran forward, and they were suddenly in
the port fire control center. An Onzarian
officer, the Third from his insignia, was at
the fire control panel. Thane looked at the
screen over the Third's head. The ship was
black and unmarked but if it was a pirate
it was by far the biggest Thane had ever
seen. The whole black hulk was turning in
space, a hundred KM away, lining up its
armament. It would only be seconds. Thane
looked at the Third. He seemed to be confused,
and was fumbling almost blindly
with the instruments. He twisted dials almost
at random, on the edge of panic.
Thane hesitated&mdash;then realized what it must
be&mdash;Stoltz artillery. The unmarked ship had
managed to get through with it, during the
microseconds of the shummer when the
screens were down.</p>

<p>He could feel some of the effect himself.
He went through a moment of indecision,
but that was all. Then he stepped
forward and shoved the Third Officer aside.
The officer looked blank, then his face reddened
in anger. As Thane tried to bring
the armament to bear, the Third was clawing
at his back. Thane bent and twisted.
The Third went crashing into a bulkhead.
Thane didn't even glance at him. There was
no time. He turned back to the fire control.
As he did, the first disrupter explosion
came, not two kilometers ahead. The next
one would get them.</p>

<p>Thane twisted the manual computer for
there was no time to wait for the automatic
to warm up. Two small adjustments and he
touched the impeller. Instantly his disrupter
burst appeared on the screen off the starboard
bow of the black enemy. Not close
enough to do real damage but enough to
throw off the pirate's next shot. The shot
came. Needles danced wildly on the board
before Thane. The whole ship vibrated
wildly. The power drain was tremendous,
but the inner screens held. As Thane lined
up the pirate again, the intercom said, "Five
seconds to warp-line!" They'd be safe, then,
after the micro second when the screens
were down. And the pirate was in position
to take full advantage of that moment.
Thane's fingers moved with scherzo speed
as he fed twelve adjustments to the fire
control. He let go with everything they had
on the port side, and switched off the guns,
in preparation for the shummer. It came
almost simultaneously, and the pirate disappeared
as they went into the hyper-space
of the warp-line. There was no time to
see if any damage had been done. His last
shots must have had effect, though, or they
would never have made it back into the
warp.</p>

<p>Thane turned away wearily from the fire-control
panel. The whole encounter had
lasted less than twenty seconds, but the
strain of fighting against the Stoltz effect
and of manually computing twelve variables
had been wearing. He saw that the Third
Officer was now standing close to Astrid.
He started to say he was sorry that he had
to act as he did. But the Third walked over
to him, with military precision, his face
set. He stood before Thane, young, military,
and serious.</p>

<p>"You have impugned my honor and that
of Onzar. For that your life is forfeit. We
fight on Kadenar."</p>

<p>"I also saved your life and my own,"
Thane said drily, "but if you want me to
take yours back, I'll be glad to oblige. See
you at Kadenar." Thane turned on his heel
and walked away.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_d.jpg" alt="D" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>uelling was forbidden by the Systems
Code but on such outposts as
Kadenar it was not only allowed but even
encouraged.</p>

<p>Therefore, no time was lost in customs.
Thane's forged Onzarian passport was
stamped "duellist priority" and that was
that. Astrid came through as readily as his
second. And the Third, with another junior
officer, was just behind them.</p>

<p>The four of them sat side by side without
a word as their automatic anti-grav taxi
took them the ten kilos from the port to
Kadenar City, and then beyond. The taxi
continued over the City and its three
"towns"&mdash;the spacetown, the bureaucrat's
town, and the miner's town&mdash;and finally
settled gently down in the foothills beyond.
There was a clearing beneath them, with
a fenced-in surface. A medic looked up as
they got out.</p>

<p>"Differences to settle, gentlemen and my
lady? Interne Pyuf at your service. The duelling
tax is three sals. Always glad to accept
any Systems currency. Then too, there's the
cremation deposit required from both parties,
the medication fee, and if you gentlemen
are interested in insurance, I'm able
to supply some very special policies."</p>

<p>After the principals and seconds had
signed the register and all fees had been
paid, Pyuf leaned back in his chair, lit one
of the fashionable 30 centimeter cigarettes,
and explained the rules. "In general, no
criminal nor civil disability attaches to actions
of the principals within this enclosure.
Certain fines, however, are imposed if the
rules are not followed. To wit: knives only
can be used, not to exceed twelve inches.
Each contestant may wear a personal anti-grav,
limited to fifteen feet ascentability.
Anti-gravs must be adjusted to compensate
for native gravities." He smiled, in self-deprecation.
"That's Pyuf the lawyer at
work. Now perhaps you prefer Pyuf the
bartender." He reached under his counter
and pulled out a bottle, labelled in the
local language, and poured out five glasses.
"To your continued good health, gentlemen,
and I sincerely hope I can return your
cremation deposits&mdash;though of course, many
previous contestants, grateful to be alive,
have contributed the amounts to the Interne's
Benefit Association."</p>

<p>Thane and the others picked up their
glasses. The stuff was yellow, sticky, sweet,
and without the slightest doubt, alcoholic.
When Thane could manage to speak, he
said, "By all means, Pyuf. I'm sure that
both my opponent and I will contribute to
the internes, dead or alive. Shall we proceed
with the main event?"</p>

<p>Before answering, Pyuf poured a small
chaser from the same bottle and stood up,
a little unsteadily. "By all means. But before
we start I might mention that I have
been ordained in fourteen systems' religions
and will be glad to perform last rites...."</p>

<p>"Enough, enough," said the Third, who
was beginning to show signs of nervousness.
"Let us get on with it."</p>

<p>Pyuf stepped over to the weapons racks
and removed a set of knives and a pair of
anti-grav jackets. He laid them on his table
and gestured to the Third. "Take a knife
and jacket." The Third chose the knife and
jacket to the left without more than a cursory
glance.</p>

<p>Pyuf reached in his jacket pocket and
brought out one of the twelve-faced dies of
Kadenar. "Pyuf, the gambler," he said.
"You two gentlemen will now roll the die.
He who is high has his choice of either
group of weapons."</p>

<p>The Third Officer rolled first, and the
Kadenar equivalent of nine came up. Thane
rolled a five.</p>

<p>"Now," said Pyuf, "it's Pyuf, the couturier.
Step forward, gentlemen, to be fitted."</p>

<p>Pyuf fitted the anti-grav jackets to Thane
and the Third, and gave each a brief, efficient
test. He stepped back and leaned
against his counter. "And now, Pyuf, the
referee." He pointed to a green line bisecting
the enclosure. "You gentlemen will remain
on the other side of the line during
the contest. You remain within the fences.
You do not ascend higher than fifteen feet.
The contest lasts till blood has been drawn
three times or until a prior fatality&mdash;or do
I need add that? At any rate, that's all the
rules. The State wishes you well, while it
frowns on your activity. To your circles,
gentlemen, and await my signal."</p>

<p>Thane judged the area marked off for
the "contest" to be about ten meters square.
It was smoothly surfaced with one of the
hard local metals, and Thane noticed a few
bloodstains near the edges. Most of them
were the dark brown of dried human blood,
but there were other alien colors mixed in
here and there.</p>

<p>As he walked across the court Thane
looked carefully at his opponent, appraising
him. They were both about the same height
but the Third had several centimeters more
reach. Probably around the equivalent of
23 years, absolute time. Certainly at the
peak of physical condition. Thane decided
on his course. He would try first for his opponent's
anti-grav. Probably the other would
try to cover his throat and belly, and Thane
might be able to get to the anti-grav by
surprise. Then, draw the blood that was in
the rules, and get the thing over. Not much
of a plan, but at least a plan.</p>

<p>There was an inset ring of some cupra-alloy
at each end of the duelling court,
about a meter in diameter. Thane reached
his end, watched his opponent, and waited
for Pyuf's signal. Pyuf slowly poured another
drink. As he raised it with his right
hand, his left arm went up over his head.
He swallowed the drink, and the left arm
came down.</p>

<p>The Third Officer came on in all-out attack.
His anti-grav assisted leap was long
and shallow, aimed at Thane's throat. At
the same moment Thane bent his knees
slightly and dropped. Just before he hit the
surface he pushed up and outward with all
his strength and twisted his body sharply.
With the assistance of the anti-grav he was
floating now directly above and behind his
opponent. He cut off the anti-grav completely
and dropped, with all the planet's
gravity. As he did, the Third twisted and
raised his knife. He lacked a fraction of a
second to complete the turn and get into
lethal position. Thane hit him on the shoulder
and instantly turned his anti-grav to
the "full" position, grabbed his opponent's
shoulders, and pushed against the court surface
with both heels.</p>

<p>They both went up and over, almost to
the fifteen meter limit. As they did, Thane
worked his knife into the anti-grav pack on
his opponent's back. Three connections, at
the top, left, and bottom. His knife cut in
and out rapidly, three times. Then he suddenly
pushed away, slipped his own anti-grav
to zero, and dropped to the surface.</p>

<p>The Third, suddenly without the assistance
of his anti-grav, crashed into the fence
and dropped leadenly to the metalled surface.
Thane crouched a moment watching
him. Thane had a cut above one eye, and
the blood was beginning to run. He stepped
forward....</p>

<p>... the knife in his hand ... what was
it there for? He should be on his way to
the rotor meet with the rest of the boys ...
he was going to win this year ... he was
going to win....</p>


<h2>III</h2>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>he first feeling Thane had when he
came out of the Stoltz shock was lightness.
He raised his right arm as he came
back to consciousness, and he noticed that
the effort required was less than he had expected.
He opened his eyes, and they gradually
came back into focus. He was lying on
a cot in a dimly lit room. The light, he
saw, came from a small window across the
room. With an unfamiliarly light tread,
Thane stepped over to the window. The
pane was double, transparent metal. It took
only one glance at the bleak, wintry landscape
outside to explain the feeling of lightness.
It could only be the landscape of
Onzar II, whose gravity was about 80%
that of Kadell IV.</p>

<p>Someone obviously had reason to cart
him, unconscious, across a few light years.
Apparently, the duel had not been what it
seemed. But how? And why? Quite possibly
the Third Officer was an agent of Onzarian
counter-espionage. If so, what had happened
to Astrid? How had Pyuf and the
others been taken care of? On the other
hand, it was quite possible that Astrid was
behind it. He remembered how she seemed
to have been talking to the Third just before
the challenge. But for what motive?
Thane smiled to himself. The speculation
was interesting, but a little barren till more
data turned up.</p>

<p>It was not long in coming. Thane had
begun to explore the room carefully when
a door opened. It was Pyuf, armed. "You'll
come with me, please." No longer the half
drunk duelling attendant, Pyuf was now
quite sober and quite serious.</p>

<p>Thane went. There were questions to be
answered.</p>

<p>He had somehow expected a long corridor
with many doors. Instead, he walked
directly into a brightly lighted room, filled
with a great deal of equipment. He recognized
the latest model lie-detector, a rather
outdated narco-synthesizer, a Class B Psychocomputer.
Much of the rest was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>There were two Onzarians in the room.
Both, in contrast to Pyuf, who was dark and
shorter than the average, had typical Onzar
features&mdash;yellow eyes with a slight slant,
and golden skin. Pyuf gestured towards
Thane. "Give him the whole routine. We
want to know everything you can get. Then
let us know."</p>

<p>Thane, of course, had been prepared for
this sort of thing. He'd spent time in Medico-Synthesis
after every major job to immunize
him against interrogation. He'd had
three separate, integrated pasts built up, all
quite fictional, which could be used during
interrogation. He was protected, at a certain
level, against physical torture, and he did
have a certain protection against most of
the drugs.</p>

<p>But the older medic simply asked him to
sit down. He did, and his assistant twisted
a few dials. Indicators gave readings, quite
a few hundred readings. A metal recorder
plate dropped out. The assistant dropped
this into the computer which began busily
to eject tape. The older man read the tape
as it ticked out. The computer stopped and
he crumpled up the tape and tossed it into
a corner. "Injection A17," he said.</p>

<p>Vaguely he heard his name. He sat up,
blinked his eyes open and looked around.
He was in quite a different room. There
were curtains at the windows, a desk, a rug,
even a fire. There was a figure in front of
him speaking to him. "Roger Thane, we
know you now. There is much that we do
not know, that has been hidden from even
our methods. But we know enough."</p>

<p>Thane was now fully alert. The voice had
been soothing, but the shock on seeing the
face, when his eyes had come back into
focus, was enough to change all his ideas.
It was Manning Reine.</p>

<p>Reine was sitting close to him, one elbow
casually thrown across the desk. He smiled,
and asked if Thane would like coffee or a
drink.</p>

<p>"I've had both," Thane said, "and they're
not what I need now. Right now all I
want is what goes on. My job, which I
didn't particularly want, was to nursemaid
you. Frankly, it's turned out to be quite a
job. After three or four very thorough
stoltzings, one space battle, a challenge, and
a duel, you have me kidnapped. All right.
I've got a reasonably open mind. I'll listen.
Now just what in the hell is going on?"</p>

<p>Manning Reine said calmly, "Undoubtedly
you have reason for anger, Thane. It
is true that we have used you. We have had
to. But you should know that there was
nothing faked about my abduction. Those
who took me were Onzarians, agents of
Candar, and they were deadly serious. It was
only with the greatest of good fortune that
I was able to escape. Only the presence of
Pyuf at Aberdeen Spaceport made it possible.</p>

<p>"And another point for your consideration.
We did not know your position.
Your appearance is Onzarian. We could
not be sure that you were what you claimed,
an agent of Liaison. And even if we could
have been sure, there were considerations
that required us to proceed with the greatest
caution. Now, I hope you will accept my
apologies and listen. There is much that you
can do, important for us and for the whole
Galaxy."</p>

<p>Thane controlled his anger and nodded
assent. At the moment it was his job to
listen if he was going to be useful from
here on in.</p>

<p>"You already have some knowledge of
the second-stage drive," Reine began. "You
already know that it frees man for flight
through the Galaxy at an average speed ten
times greater than that now possible with
the present warp-line drive. You are aware
of the warp-line type of movement. We cannot
leave the warps without reverting to
finite drive. As you know, the warps are
electro-gravitic lines of force in space, along
which interstellar travel has proved possible
with certain devices...."</p>

<p>"As you say," Thane broke in, "I know
all that. I know too that the second-stage
drive allows practically instantaneous travel
across the warps. But just what does that
have to do with your disappearance, and the
attacks that have been made on me?"</p>

<p>"Just this. I am, you know, one of the researchers
responsible for the development of
the second-stage drive. I am more than that.
I am also the present leader of the Onzarian
underground."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_m.jpg" alt="M" width="42" height="40" /></div>
<p>anning Reine relaxed in his chair
and sipped his coffee. "At the same
time I want you to understand that I am
completely, wholeheartedly loyal to the Allied
Systems. As you know, I was educated
at Earth University at a time when that was
possible for an Onzarian. I left Onzar for
good at the beginning of the Candar revolution,
expecting to devote the rest of my life
to research within the A.S. But now I am
convinced that Candar must be overthrown
if our own systems are to survive."</p>

<p>"It's a proposition that will take some
explaining," Thane said coldly.</p>

<p>"The basic ideas are simple enough,"
Reine said, "once you see how they fit together.
There is, of course, nothing new
about the basic theory of the second-stage
drive. Even at the beginning of the ancient
atomic era, scientists were groping for the
Unified Field. The basic unified field equations
were the first step. Then came the
charting of the electro-gravitic lines of stress
in space, which we know familiarly as warp-lines.
That was the foundation for faster-than-light
travel, and all that went with it.
But of course it was awkward. We could not
leave the warp-lines unless we returned to
finite speed. We could change direction only
at the intersection of warps. Many star-systems
were far off the warp-lines, and could
be reached only after days or weeks of
travel at finite speeds."</p>

<p>"All very true," said Thane, "but it still
doesn't explain a thing to me. About your
place in this or Candar's."</p>

<p>Reine hardly noticed the interruption. He
went on, professorially. "The solution has
always seemed clear. In order to travel at
will through space, at faster-than-light
speeds all we needed to do was to create our
own Field with its own warp-line. If a ship
could generate its own electro-gravitic warp
it would be able to travel in almost unlimited
directions with no time lapse except
for pauses at each warp-line crossed. The
power factors were such that an entirely
new principle of operation was needed. We
have found it in the so-called gold catalyst
principle, and we now have a practical,
economical second-stage drive."</p>

<p>Thane frowned. "But that would seem to
make Onzar less important. Why do we
need to worry about them now?"</p>

<p>Reine was about to answer but the door
opened and Pyuf was there. "How goes it,
duellist?"</p>

<p>"It was a great fight," Thane said, "until
you decided to tear up the rules. You forgot
to tell me that you included 'kidnapper'
in your list of trades."</p>

<p>Reine smiled. "That's just one of many
that Pyuf forgot to mention. Forger, propagandist,
and political theorist might also
have been added." He turned to Pyuf. "I've
about covered the technology. Why don't
you give our friend the politics?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Pyuf sat on the desk swinging his
short legs. "First, though, I'm sorry about
the duel, Thane. We had to do it."</p>

<p>"Reine's already assured me of that once
or twice," Thane said drily. "I would like
to know, though, just how you did it."</p>

<p>"That's simple enough. For months now
we've been using the duelling court on Kadenar
as an exchange point in the underground.
It's been very helpful because of
the ease that duellists have in getting
through customs. In your case we were
lucky. Or I should say that Astrid was quick
and intelligent enough to take advantage of
a fortunate situation. A few words from her
were enough to instigate the Onzarian officer
to challenge you. Remember that Onzarians
have a tradition of duelling, and you had
insulted him. Furthermore, he was still confused
from the stoltz artillery."</p>

<p>"Clear enough. But may I ask why you
bothered to let the duel go on at all? Why
not just take me when we got to the court?"</p>

<p>"We wanted to explain your disappearance.
At the same time that you were unconscious,
your opponent and the other junior
officer were also out. With a touch of post-hypnotic
suggestion, they were both quite
convinced that the Third Officer had won
the duel and that you were dead. We had
no trouble getting your 'corpse' back
through customs and to Onzar."</p>

<p>"Probably," Thane said, "you had a purpose
for all this. Before we go any further,
let's have it."</p>

<p>"If you were an agent of Candar we
would have eliminated you," Pyuf said.
"You had already learned too much, and
you had shown that you were a dangerous
man. If you were a Liaison agent, it was
still necessary for you to 'die.' At the
moment, it's imperative that no word of our
activity gets to the Allied Systems. And, if
we can convince you, we badly need your
help."</p>

<p>"It'll take some convincing from what's
happened up to now. But go ahead."</p>

<p>"Ever wonder," Pyuf went on, "why the
Darzent Empire hasn't attacked? What are
they waiting for? They're aggressive. They
have the edge in power, with two inhabited
systems to one in the A.S. Their technology
matches ours and their heavily centralized
dictatorship allows them to move faster, at
least at the beginning of a war."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Two reasons. One, they never could be
sure that we didn't have the second-stage
drive. Two, they couldn't be sure of the allegiance
of Onzar."</p>

<p>"Onzar&mdash;the whole five systems&mdash;is probably
more of an armed camp than any other
political entity in the Galaxy. But that isn't
the real reason for their overwhelming importance."
Pyuf jumped down off the desk
and flipped a switch on the far wall. The
galactic map appeared, with the warp-lines
superimposed in red.</p>

<p>Pyuf pointed with his cigarette. "Take
a look at those warps. All nine of the principal
ones, crossing the Galaxy between the
Allied Systems and the Darzent Empire,
pass within a parsec of Onzar. A faster-than-light
fleet going either way <i>has</i> to surface
at the Onzar Confluence. And Candar,
no matter how he sounds to you or me, is
no fool. He, you can bet, has taken some
long quiet looks at a map like this and he
knows his position. So does Darzent. So do
the people who are presumably running
things in the Allied Systems."</p>

<p>Thane stood up. He had been off at the
perimeter of the struggle, working in obscure
but possibly important systems for the
past three years. He hadn't been in a position
to see all the factors in the struggle
that was shaping up. But now at a glance he
saw that Pyuf was probably right. "It makes
sense," he admitted, "but what about the
second-stage drive? Isn't that supposed to
cut across warp-lines? Wouldn't that reduce
to zero the strategic importance of our
friend, Candar?"</p>

<p>At this, Manning Reine broke in excitedly,
"But that's just the point, Thane!
Remember I mentioned there were certain
limits to the second-stage drive. We can, to
a large extent, manufacture our own lines.
But they are never wholly independent of
the existing natural lines through space.
Our dependence on the galactic lines varies
from almost zero to almost unitary, depending
on our position in space. The Onzarian
Confluence has much the same effect
as a whirlpool. Theoretically, we could
force our way out of the whirlpool and go
through the center of the Galaxy by a different
route. But the energy required approaches
infinity."</p>

<p>Thane stepped over to the map. He
pointed to the Onzarian Confluence. "O.K.
There's our bottleneck. But where's the
cork? Just how do you figure on stopping a
fleet if it does surface at the Onzarian Confluence
for two or three microseconds?"</p>

<p>Pyuf slapped the butt of his cigarette
across the tray on Reine's desk. "There,
Agent Thane, we reach the point of the
whole show. But let's get the story straight
from the source." His eyes went to Reine.</p>

<p>Reine, pouring his second cup of coffee,
looked up. "If you mean me, that's not very
accurate. It's true that it was developed in
my laboratory but Astrid was the one who
saw the hint, originally, and did all the development.
I'm not even familiar with all
the details." He smiled apologetically to
Thane. "We're talking about the Tracer. As
a by-product of our main job we discovered
a new way of plotting warp-lines. Instead
of doing it by mathematics we found a way of
plotting warps directly by instrument. Well,
I was on the main line of research, and I
had three times as much as I could do already.
I just regarded this as a curiosity. But
Astrid took it and built the Tracer."</p>

<p>Pyuf interrupted. He was not the man,
Thane saw, who could abide technical explanations
when they had a clear political
implication. "The Tracer," he said, "is the
cork for your bottleneck. With the tracer,
we know when any ship is operating on second-stage
drive. With two tracers, separated
on a baseline of a few million kilometers,
we can plot position closely. Three tracers
will pin-point them, and for a trip across the
center of the Galaxy, we will know when
and where they'll have to surface."</p>

<p>"That fits all right," Thane said, "but
why tie in Onzar? Why not let the Allied
Systems have the tracer?"</p>

<p>Pyuf shrugged impatiently. "Gentlemen,
from here on, we need a drink. The explanation
is simple, limpid, computable
logic. As far as we can see, it's the only
course." He stared pointedly at Thane. "But
it also could be construed as treason. So we'd
better have a drink." He stepped to the
door. "Astrid, will you bring glasses and the
bottle? We've got a bit of dialectics to dispense
with."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="37" height="40" /></div>
<p>fter Astrid had handed the drinks
around, Pyuf downed his. Then he
went on. "First of all, Thane, don't get me
wrong. Maybe I couldn't pass a security
check with some of the boys in the Department
of the Outside. Maybe I could, I don't
know. I've never tried. But I like the Allied
Systems as well as anything the Galaxy
has to offer and I want to live there. But
let's take a hard look at them." He stopped
to pour another glass. "Within the A.S. you
have the main federation, and you have a
lot of loosely confederated systems. Space
only knows what the confederations will do.
We can only hope. But look at the rest of
them. Every couple of years, absolute, they
rear back and elect an assembly of 13,000
members, a really efficient size for a deliberative
body. So that sterling group elects
a senate of 300 or so, and then goes home.
But it reserves a lot of rights, like declaring
war. And the senate, of course, goes
ahead and elects the council. Which does
its best to keep things going."</p>

<p>"I know the system," Thane broke in.
"Just what do you want to do about it?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to do anything about it,"
Pyuf looked up earnestly. "I want to prevent
it from being wiped out. And right now the
only way that can be done is to work outside
it, rather than through it. Or do you want
to hold a systems election when the Darzent
fleet surfaces at Onzar Confluence?"</p>

<p>Manning Reine was on his feet now.
"And they will, Thane, they will. We know
there have been security leaks in the development
of the drive. It's just a question of
time."</p>

<p>Thane calmly reached over and took the
bottle from Pyuf. He filled his glass and
looked at the bottle, then at Pyuf, Astrid,
and Reine. "All right. We have our bottleneck.
And we have our cork&mdash;the Onzarian
fleet. Just how do you propose we shove
the cork into the bottle?"</p>

<p>Astrid was the first to answer. "We'll
take the fleet! The Onzarians are ready for
freedom!" After that they were all talking.
The underground had convinced the people
of the truth. They were ready to rise up and
throw off the yoke of Candar. There was
conflict between the government and the
religion. The people would not stand any
further reduction in their living standards.
Two-thirds of the gross product went for
armaments now, and the amount was steadily
increasing.</p>

<p>At last Thane banged the desk until they
had all stopped talking. He looked at them
a moment in silence. "All right. You've
got your gadgets. You've got your political
theory. You've even got your strategy. But
there hasn't been an atom's worth of tactics
in anything you've said, any of you. I think
you're badly in need of some engineering
for your revolution."</p>

<p>Astrid walked over and looked up into
his eyes. "That's about the way it is, Roger.
And that's why we need you so badly."</p>

<p>That was when they began going into
details. Strength of the underground, possible
allies, weaknesses of Candar.... Thane
was beginning to see the picture, and the
tremendous obstacles to be overcome, when
a buzzer sounded and a red light over the
door blinked DANGER ... DANGER ...
DANGER....</p>


<h2>IV</h2>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_p.jpg" alt="P" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>yuf ran over to a cabinet on the wall
by the fire. Thane saw there were several
dials and a visiscreen. As Pyuf twisted
the dials he spoke rapidly over his shoulder
to Thane. "We're quite isolated here. The
house belongs to the old boy you met in
the lab. He's been checked for security by
Candar so we figured we were safe here.
There's a detection screen about a kilometer
hour from the house, and we have a force
screen we can use as a last resort. Of course,
we'd have to abandon this place once we
did use it. Candar's detectors would pick it
up right away."</p>

<p>The visiscreen came into focus and Pyuf
turned the perimeter dial till it lined up
with the degree mark on the disturbance
indicator. Nine figures appeared, advancing
toward the house. Three were short and
squat&mdash;not over a meter and a half in
height. They walked with the peculiar
slouch of the Darzent entity in its humanoid
phase. The other six were the Darzent robot
infantry. Two and a half meters high, impervious
to any hand weapon, with built-in
blasters and the Darzent version of the
Stoltz gun. Their ship was in the background.
It had the outlines of an ordinary
atmosphere jet of medium size, but there
were alterations which made Thane suspect
that it had been refitted for deep space, with
at least the finite drive, and probably FTL.</p>

<p>Thane spun around to the others. "We
either put up the force screen or get out
now," he said. "Unless, that is, there's some
heavy artillery around the house. Nothing
else will stop a Darzent Robot. And even
the screen probably won't last long. That
ship looks as though it has enough high
powered stuff to breach any screen we can
put up."</p>

<p>Astrid looked up at him. "We do have
the jet, Roger. It's armed, but it will take
time to get it ready for take-off."</p>

<p>"Let's get the force screen up now, then."</p>

<p>Pyuf snapped switches. The whine of
power at emergency levels began. The Darzent
force had screen detectors, because they
stopped at once and turned back to their
ship. Short, sharp rocket blasts shot out
from the bow tubes of the ship, as it turned
on its axis to attack the force screen.</p>

<p>"Let's get going," Thane said.</p>

<p>"We all can't go," Pyuf pointed out.
"Our jet is only two-place, and anyway,
someone will have to cut off the screen to
let the jet out."</p>

<p>"You and I can do it," Astrid said to
Thane. "I can handle the engines and the
defensive screens while you fly it and man
the gun."</p>

<p>Thane considered quickly. If they succeeded
in knocking out the Darzent forces
they'd be able to get the others out without
difficulty. If not, it would be wise to separate
Astrid and her father. With one of them,
the plan that was shaping up might succeed,
but if both were lost there'd be no chance.</p>

<p>"All right," Thane said. "Let's go."</p>

<p>Just then the first attack on the screen
came. There was vibration through the room
and the needles of the indicators all jumped
up over the red lines. The whine of power
momentarily became a shriek and then died
down.</p>

<p>"That was close," Thane said. "The
sooner we stop them the better." He turned
to Pyuf. "Drop the screen for two seconds
when I signal, to let us out."</p>

<p>The bitterly cold wind cut into Astrid
and Thane as they hurried outside. Astrid
was ahead, leaning against the wind, running
towards the outbuilding which housed
the jet. They were in full view of the
Darzent attackers who renewed their thrust
at the screen when they saw the running
figures.</p>

<p>"We won't take time to ease it out,"
Thane shouted above the wind. "Full power
at the start. It'll knock over this shack but
that's a small loss at the moment."</p>

<p>Thane climbed into the nose position of
the little jet while Astrid slid in behind
him. They ran a fast check while the engines
warmed. Thane waited for the next attack
on the force screen. It came and he gave a
short sharp blast to signal their readiness.
They had two seconds leeway before the
screen went up again. The ship was not
fully warmed. Thane flicked on all the
rockets and gave the jet full throttle.</p>

<p>There was the barest hesitation, and then
they were forced back in their seats, with
5G acceleration. The outbuilding flamed
and collapsed behind them. As Thane went
into semi-consciousness he pulled back on
the control wheel to clear the hill ahead.
The corners of his mouth pulled down, his
eyeballs felt as if they were being forced
down into his cheekbones. His vision became
a red blur, then grey....</p>

<p>He came out and looked down. The house
and the Darzent ship were tiny blurs in the
storm, three kilometers below. He looked
back at Astrid. "Make it all right?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>Her face was white and strained but she
managed a smile. "Still with you, skipper.
Let's get back down."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft1"><img src="images/image_h1.jpg" alt="H" width="54" height="40" /></div>
<p>ere we go. Hang on and hope. Keep
the screens up till I nod. Then drop
them fast." Thane put the jet into a steep
dive, lining up the Darzent ship in the
sights of the Baring gun. He was ready to
fire when there was a tremendous jolt and a
flash of light. The little jet was thrown over
on its back and Thane fought the controls
to steady it.</p>

<p>He went into a climbing turn and saw,
above and behind him, the long black shape
of an Onzarian atmosphere cruiser. "The
protector screens are dead," Astrid cried in
alarm. "Whatever that was that hit us
burned them out!"</p>

<p>"That was a disrupter." He pointed at
the Onzarian cruiser. "Our visitor is playing
for keeps." His knuckles went white as he
pulled back on the wheel into another long
climb with emergency power. Another disrupter
burst behind them barely missed.</p>

<p>"They've got everything on us," he said.
"Speed, firepower and range. Except maneuverability."
He turned to Astrid. "Just
how far out is the force screen from the
house?"</p>

<p>"Four hundred meters."</p>

<p>"Let's see if we can judge it," he said
grimly. "It's going to be close." He put the
jet into a tight turn and slipped off into a
steep, screaming dive. There was another
disrupter burst and a sudden flutter of the
controls. He fought them to maintain the
dive, straight for the house and its invisible
bubble of force. The flutter became worse
as their speed increased, and vibration
racked the whole ship. He judged the distance
by the range-finder on the Baring. At
the last moment he pulled out and up. The
ship skidded down sickeningly, and then
caught. Thane fought bitterly to keep conscious.</p>

<p>They heard the explosion above the sound
of the wind shrieking past them. Thane
looked down and back. It had worked! The
Onzar ship had followed them down, but it
had not allowed for the invisible force
screen. It had hit the screen, caromed off
into a wild, twisting skid, and hit the
ground, completely wrecked.</p>

<p>But Thane had time only for a glance.
The vibration was getting worse. One more
strain and the little jet would be torn to
pieces.</p>

<p>He eased out of the climb and tried to
put the jet into a long flat glide. It kept
slipping off to the right, and the glide increased
in steepness. The ground came up
and he managed to pull back into a partial
stall. At the last instant the jet dipped to
the right and hit. It spun crazily on the
ground, straightened, skidded and then
buried itself in a drift of snow.</p>

<p>He was still numb with shock when he
heard Astrid's voice. "What happened,
Roger? Why did they attack us?"</p>

<p>"They must have been sent as soon as
our force screen was detected. Let's get
back."</p>

<p>They climbed out into the biting wind
and started towards the house in the distance.
The red sun of Onzar was setting
and the cold deepened and chilled bitterly
as they hurried on.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_i.jpg" alt="I" width="16" height="40" /></div>
<p>t was almost dark when they reached
the house. In the lengthening shadows
there was no sign of the Darzent ship. They
hurried on in growing fear. The front of
the house showed the signs of the blast that
had knocked out the force screen. Inside the
house was dark. All power had been burned
out when the screen went. They went in
through the smashed, tilted doorway. In
the gloom they saw the old medic first. He
was slumped in a chair against one wall.
His neck was twisted and his head slanted
back. His chest was a gaping hole, with the
blood already frozen. His assistant lay beside
the dead fire, headless. What had been Pyuf
was at the instrument cabinet, one hand still
on the fused panel. Manning Reine was
not there.</p>

<p>There was a tremble of panic in Astrid's
voice. "Roger, they killed them ... and ...
where is Dad?"</p>

<p>"They killed them deliberately with hand
weapons after they knocked down the
screen. And they have your father now.
That was their purpose."</p>

<p>"What will they do to him? Where have
they taken him? Roger, we've got to find
him!"</p>

<p>Roger Thane turned to her in the shambles
of the wrecked room. The quaver in
her voice indicated that she couldn't take
much more. He took her arm and led her
down the corridor to the laboratory. "We're
going to fight back, Astrid, and we're going
to win. Right now there's not much we can
do for your father. But don't worry about
him. He's safe. He's much too valuable to
be mistreated by the Darzent Empire. But
they will get everything they need from him
with their interrogatory drugs."</p>

<p>In the laboratory nothing had been
touched. Once the Darzent force had Reine
they must have left at once. Astrid's shoulders
were shaking as Thane led her to a
chair. "We've got a lot to plan and a lot
to do. It won't be easy and we'll be fighting
all the way. But we'll win if we're steady."</p>

<p>Thane could see the effort Astrid was
making. "I'm ... I'm ready, Roger. Where
do we start?"</p>

<p>"We'll start with what we have, the
underground. And Astrid, the really important
jobs may be up to you because I'm
going to be out of circulation for a while."
Astrid looked up with a question on her
lips but he went on before she could voice
it. "Pyuf mentioned that we have some
support among the Onzarian priestesshood.
Just what do we have?"</p>

<p>"There's been general dissatisfaction with
Candar all through the religion," she said.
Her voice was low, carefully controlled,
with an undercurrent of stress. "The whole
priestesshood feels that Candar is their
enemy. They feel that Candar's eventual
aim is to destroy every organization not
under his direct control. Of course, the
church also has a long tradition of remaining
aloof from the temporal government.
And outwardly, Candar has so far usually
respected the church."</p>

<p>She looked up at Thane. "That's the
general picture. Actual proved sympathizers
with the underground are scarce, but we
do have some important ones. Probably the
most important is the Priestess of Keltar,
Selan. As she's the head of the church in
Keltar, the capitol city, she's at least nominally
the head of the whole organization,
though it does have a good deal of autonomy.
But her word carries enormous
weight."</p>

<p>"What's she like?"</p>

<p>"She's old. Very old and very determined.
She's always been on the liberal wing of
the church. Willing to recognize the changes
that have taken place, and to modify the
church so that it will maintain its place in
the system. She recognizes Candar for what
he is but is willing to try to get along with
him till someone can show her an alternative
with a chance of success. At least, that's how
she seemed to me when I met her."</p>

<p>"Do you think," Thane asked, "that she
would be ready to help now if it meant the
overthrow of Candar?"</p>

<p>Astrid was silent for a long time. Finally
she nodded. "I think so. I don't know but
I think she would."</p>

<p>Thane glanced at his watch. It might do.
And they just might have time for what
had to be done. "It's the best chance we
have, and it may work. But now we've got
things to do. We can use some of the
equipment here, and the batteries will give
us enough power."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>hane rapidly explained that he was
going back into his own identity, and
that some of the equipment present would
help accelerate the change-over. He tried
to give Astrid the general picture as they
made the circuit changes on the equipment.</p>

<p>"Astrid, you are going to turn me in.
You are going to surrender me to the
Onzarians when they get here."</p>

<p>Astrid stopped. She had been re-fusing
a circuit, and the fuse hung limply in her
hand, forgotten.</p>

<p>Thane went on. "I'll explain while we
finish the circuit. We haven't much time.
You remember how we talked of driving
the cork into the bottle? Well, that's what
we're going to do. The Onzarians will be
here before long when they've discovered
their cruiser is missing. You will pass as an
Onzarian. As an acolyte of the religion,
you'll turn me over to them as a spy."</p>

<p>They had finished the identity accelerator
circuit. Thane wasn't sure the rough equipment
would do, but it might be close
enough. He'd try it. He climbed on to the
laboratory table and showed Astrid how to
make the connections.</p>

<p>"I'm using all the power we have," he
said. "I'll be out about 13 minutes, absolute.
If they get here before then do everything
you can to keep them out till the time's up."</p>

<p>Astrid looked down at him lying on the
table. She was very serious, very quiet. She
brushed her lips lightly against his forehead
and said softly, "We'll manage."</p>

<p>She was gone and Thane heard the hum
of power.</p>

<p>It went on and on, in the easy world of
change. And then the power was gone.
Thane struggled to open his eyes, minutes,
years before he should. He looked up into
the cold, unfriendly eyes of an Onzarian
lieutenant.</p>

<p>Astrid appeared beside the lieutenant.
She talked rapidly in Onzarian. Her manner
was imperious, "He's the one. He did it all.
He attacked us here, and after he had killed
the others he admitted to me that he was a
spy for the A. S. He would have killed me,
too, if you hadn't come, lieutenant."</p>

<p>The lieutenant said harshly, "He won't
trouble anyone now. Candar, himself will
deal with him."</p>

<p>Thane was pulled to his feet by two crew
members. Each grasped one of his arms, and
they took him out of the house to the
waiting Onzar cruiser. Inside the ship one
of them opened a reinforced door and
shoved him into a tiny cell.</p>

<p>Thane had been in jails before on other
systems. Their politics varied but their jails
were about the same. He didn't like it, but
he did know what to expect. There was the
take-off, and the trip to the sector patrol
station. The lieutenant told his story and
they questioned him, in a cursory, routine
way. He was an important political prisoner
and there were experts to take care of the
questioning later on. Then there was another
ship, and they flew through the long,
bitterly cold night to the capitol city, Keltar.
More guards, more questions on arrival. The
receiving station. And finally the trip
through the ancient streets of Keltar to the
palace prison.</p>

<p>The cell there was just as small, just as
dark, just as dirty as the others. But at least
he was in a cell by himself. He was alone,
and would have time to think through his
plan.</p>

<p>Time went by. Thane, without light,
without sound, did not know how long.
But long enough. Long enough for the Darzent
Empire to learn about the second-stage
drive, from a drugged Manning Reine.
Long enough to begin to equip their fleet
with the drive. Could one man stop their
attack? Thane wondered, and planned, and
waited impatiently.</p>

<p>No prison sounds. No noise of any kind.
Until suddenly the duralite door opened.
"Let's go," the gruff Onzarian voice said.</p>

<p>Outside the cell door Thane's eyes gradually
focused in the light. The guard was one
he hadn't seen when they'd brought him in.
Apparently he'd been in the cell through at
least one watch, possibly longer. They
walked down the long row of doors to the
registry room.</p>


<h2>V</h2>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>he room was bare except for a bench
along one wall, a chair and a small
table. A non-com sat behind the table. He
began to ask the usual questions. Thane
answered in a flat, dull voice, and the non-com
filled out a form, scribbling on a line
or checking a box as each question was answered.
Finally he shoved the form aside
and looked up at Thane for the first time.
"Oh, an Alien, eh? That should be interesting
for you." He jerked a thumb at the
bench. "Sit there till you're called." Thane
went over to the bench. He saw that the
non-com had lit a cigarette and was staring
into endless boredom.</p>

<p>For long, empty minutes nothing happened.
Then there was noise at the outer
doors. The doors opened and two burly
guards entered. Astrid Reine was between
them.</p>

<p>They dragged her up to the desk. "They
told us to bring her here."</p>

<p>The non-com looked up. "What's the
purpose?" That, Thane was sure, was the
correct translation of the Onzarian. Not
'charge,' not 'offense,' but 'purpose.' It was
a one-word explanation of Candar's whole
system of justice.</p>

<p>"... and she claimed to be an acolyte of
the church," the bigger guard was saying.
"Gave the name of a registered acolyte and
everything. And funny thing, the Priestess
of Keltar vouched for her. Had to let her
go. But then we found out that the acolyte
she was supposed to be was across the continent,
in Akra. We picked her up just as
she was leaving the cathedral." At the end
of his long speech, the guard sucked in his
breath and blew it out, hoarsely.</p>

<p>The non-com merely sighed, picked up
his pad of forms, and began his questions.
Astrid answered most of the questions in a
monotone. She gave no sign that she had
seen or recognized Thane. He noticed that
on a few of her questions, her voice went
up. He saw why.</p>

<p>The non-com had finished the body of his
form and was filling in the "remarks." His
stylus poised, he asked, "Why did you go
to the priestess?"</p>

<p>Astrid's voice went up as she answered,
"She's all right." Then her voice went back
to a dull monotone. "I&mdash;I was confused.
After I'd told them I was in the church I
thought she would help me. But she
couldn't."</p>

<p>"What were you trying to do?"</p>

<p>"I've done everything," she said in that
slightly altered tone. "I don't know what
I was going to do. I've been so confused."
She bent her head and began to sob.</p>

<p>"Take her away," the non-com said. The
two guards led her into the cell block. As
they left, the intercom buzzed beside the
non-com. He answered and gestured to
Thane. "Time for you, Mister. Stand up
and wait."</p>

<p>Two officers of the guard entered. The
gold on the uniform of one indicated that
he was at least a commander. They took him
between them, without a word, and went
out.</p>

<p>The wind tore at them as they walked
across the palace court. Each sentry snapped
to attention as they passed. Inside, they
were inspected formally by a guard and
more efficiently by a battery of detectors.
They hurried on. After halls, corridors,
steps, grav-wells, and more guards, they
reached the door. One final check and they
were through.</p>

<p><i>Glistered</i>&mdash;that was the word&mdash;the whole
room glistered. Gold inset in the wall
panels. Golden arms on the chairs. Gold
plating on the ceiling. A gold shagell, wings
outstretched, at one corner of Candar's
enormous desk. And Candar, in a perfectly
plain uniform, staring up at him from
behind the desk. His own expensive way,
Thane considered, for showing his contempt
for the gold fetish of the church.</p>

<p>Candar looked up at him steadily for
a moment without speaking. Then: "I always
greet the emissaries from the Allied
Systems personally. They always have so
much of interest to tell us in one way or
another sooner or later."</p>

<p>Thane stared back and said, "You are
right. I have information that will save
Onzar if I give it to you. Perhaps, using
your methods, you could get it eventually.
Perhaps not. But eventually is too late,
Candar."</p>

<p>Candar picked up a small gold knife. "Go
on," he said, "but do not bluff. I do not
like bluffs."</p>

<p>"There is no question of bluffing," Thane
said impatiently. "But there are other matters
that must be settled before I will go
on."</p>

<p>"Just what would you have us settle,
spy?" Candar asked sardonically.</p>

<p>"First, the matter of my own immunity.
I'm being hunted throughout the Galaxy.
The Allied Systems are searching for me.
Darzent agents have attacked me twice. I
have disregarded orders and I'm about to
commit treason if I'm assured of safety."</p>

<p>Candar put down the knife and leaned
forward. His voice showed his reluctant
interest as well as his habitual suspicion.
"Tell me why, spy. Why should I assure
your safety?"</p>

<p>Thane said scornfully, "I didn't say that
you should assure it. I said I wanted it
assured. And it will be. If it isn't, you'll
be wiped out, and what's left of the Onzar
system will be in slavery."</p>

<p>"You may think, Systems Spy, that you
know the kind of death you will die if this
is a trick," Candar said slowly and coldly.
"But you do not. There are specialists here,
experts whose life work is the gradual dispatching
of men who try to trick Candar."
He paused for a moment. "If you can prove
what you say, I, Candar, will personally
guarantee your safety and immunity."</p>

<p>Thane snorted. "You'll get your proof,
but not on your personal guarantee. You'll
transfer me to the custody of the church on
the condition that I'll be turned back to you
if I can't prove everything I say."</p>

<p>Candar pushed himself to his feet. Thane
could see the veins throbbing in his forehead.
"That's enough!" The harsh voice
mounted to a roar. "You have insulted
Onzar and its ruler." He turned to his
officers. "Take him out. We'll see what he
knows, and how much he can stand before
his death."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>he room they entered was a spotlessly
clean room, an antiseptic room. Thane
wondered how often the blood was scrubbed
from the floor as he recognized the instruments.</p>

<p>They pushed him into a chair and
strapped him down. "Now let's see what
he'll take," Candar said. The commander
himself applied the fittings and turned on
the switches. Then the pain came. In long
shivering waves. No body pain. Just pure
pain, applied directly to the synapses of his
brain. It was unbearable&mdash;and then it got
worse. It went up and up. Through a dim
red haze, Thane saw Candar shove the dial
up still another notch. Then he blanked out.</p>

<p>As he came back he looked up at them.
Stinging drops of sweat blurred his vision
but he managed to smile. "Now try your
psychograph. Just try it. Here's what you'll
read: <i>conditioned against physical torture.
Brain waves lack stable pattern. History inconsistent.
Standard drug susceptibility predicted
negative.</i> Then decide, friends, if I'm
bluffing."</p>

<p>Candar growled, "Do as he says."</p>

<p>The test was run. They looked at the
results. All three of them walked over to
the corner of the room behind him. With
his head strapped he could not see them.
He heard their conversation in undertones.
He broke in. "There's your choice, Candar.
Kill me or turn me over to the church. And
if you're afraid to know what's coming, if
you're afraid to know how you're going to
die, you'd better kill me now."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Then Candar:
"Unstrap him." Candar walked up and
stood before him as the straps were taken
off. "You'll curse yourself for postponing
the end, if this is a trick. The transfer papers
will be prepared now." He gestured to the
commander. "Bring him back to my chambers,
and call the emissary of the church."
The door slammed jarringly behind him as
he strode out.</p>

<p>When the conditions were made out,
signed and countersigned and sealed, and a
copy transmitted to the Cathedral of Keltar,
and when the young emissary in cloth-of-gold
had signed the receipt for him, Thane
began. "At this moment," he started, "the
Darzent Empire is preparing an attack. They
have a space-drive, stolen from the Allied
Systems, which allows almost instantaneous
travel through the Galaxy. You will learn
of this drive, and you will learn something
that Darzent does not know. You will learn
how to locate any ship using this drive at
any time the drive is in operation."</p>

<p>That was enough to stimulate Candar's
driving, paranoid megalomania to the full.
Thane had already threatened him with
destruction. Now he held out to him the
opportunity to be master of the Galaxy.
Thane felt it would be simple now to obtain
the transfer of Astrid to the custody of the
church. He thought so, but there was another
hour of argument before he had overcome
Candar's suspicions and convinced
him of the absolute necessity of having
Astrid to supervise the building of the
Tracer and the Drive.</p>

<p>At last it was settled. Then Thane committed
his treason. He told all he knew,
about the second-stage drive and the tracer,
and when Astrid came in, she finished the
job. Between them they gave away the most
important secrets of the Galaxy to an enemy,
a man of endless, pathologic ambition.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_c.jpg" alt="C" width="30" height="40" /></div>
<p>andar, of course, wanted confirmation.
It was fast in coming. With all
the technical resources of Onzar at her disposal,
Astrid had a prototype of the tracer
in operation the following day. An hour
later the existence of a ship using the catalyst
drive was reported by the tracer. Its position
could not be determined until a base
line had been established. The following
day, three more tracers were set up at widely
separated points across the planet. More
movement of ships was reported&mdash;and they
were definitely placed within the Darzent
Empire. One more day passed, and more
tracers had been set up on Onzar III, across
the sun from the capitol planet.</p>

<p>At the same time, Candar pushed work
on the second-stage drive with all possible
speed. As Thane had guessed, the use of
gold in the catalyst principle gave Candar
pause, but only momentarily. It was true
that such a use of gold violated one of the
oldest and strongest taboos in the religion
but Candar's hunger for power was stronger
than his fear of revolt. As Thane had supposed,
Candar went ahead with the development
of the drive, thinking that when he
had it his power would enable him to ignore
the church. The church was powerful on
just this system. With the drive, Candar
would rule the Galaxy.</p>

<p>Candar had taken certain precautions.
Almost complete radio silence had been
clamped down, partially to prevent any information
getting out, and partially to provide
enough power for the tracer. No ships
of any registry could enter or leave the
system. Only his personal adherents of unquestioned
loyalty were allowed to work
on the assembly of the drive. But there were
leaks. And there was Thane....</p>

<p>With one legal pretext after another,
Candar had succeeded in keeping Thane in
isolation within the palace for three days.
Finally, he gave in to the demand of the
church that Thane be turned over to the
Cathedral. He did not want Thane loose
but still he could not afford a break with
the church just a few days before his great
victory.</p>

<p>So Thane at last managed to see Selan
in her personal chambers in the Keltar
Cathedral. It was a small, comfortable room
that did not seem to share the bleakness of
most of Onzar. Perhaps, as much as anything,
that was due to the personality of the
Priestess Selan. She was very old. She had
remained slim, and her lined face retained
much of its original golden color. Her yellow
eyes were alert. The only term Thane
could think of for their expression was
cynical compassion. She sat by a small
writing table in one of the traditional,
intricately carved chairs of Onzar.</p>

<p>"The developments of the past few days,
Priestess Selan, are of extreme importance
to Onzar and the church. The tracer device
has already confirmed our belief that Darzent
is preparing to attack. Already their
trial maneuvers with the second-stage drive
have ceased, and they have begun the marshalling
of their fleet. When they come,
they must come through the Onzar Confluence,
not more than a parsec from this
system. This attack must be stopped, and
we hope that time enough is left."</p>

<p>"I am aware of these developments,
Roger Thane," she said with a slight smile.
"We still have our sources of information."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Thane said, "you are also
aware of the industrial use of gold in the
second-stage drive?"</p>

<p>"We have heard rumors," she said wearily,
"but perhaps my position on such matters
is not clear to you. I have never been
a religious doctrinaire. I have lived through
tremendous changes on this planet, and I
know that the church must conform to survive.
You certainly must know that from the
history of religions in your own system. The
church is conservative, yes. It can never
move with the skeptical flexibility of the
politician or the scientist. But it must change
with them, sometimes leading, sometimes
following. Otherwise it becomes a thing of
quaintness, a building without an institution,
a place for tourists."</p>

<p>Thane regarded her thoughtfully for a
moment. Even this brilliant, experienced
woman would be ensnared by her own long-range
theories into a disastrous inaction in
the short-run crisis. And there would be no
long-range for her or her church unless
there were victory in the present crisis. He
said, "I agree with you completely. Like
any organism, social or biological, the
church must adapt to continue. It must survive.
And the present situation is not merely
one in which an ancient taboo is violated.
It is a crisis of survival for you."</p>

<p>"I know," she said thoughtfully, "that
Candar has never been friendly to the
church. But I do not believe that he has the
power to destroy it."</p>

<p>"Up to now," Thane answered, "Candar
has been limited. Now, with the drive, he
feels that unlimited power is his. His dream
is to crush the power of Darzent in this
attack, and then to turn upon the Allied
Systems. I do not know if his dream of
complete domination of the Galaxy can be
realized. I do not think so. But it is something
he will not put away. And when he
makes the attempt, it will mean the destruction
of millions, the killing of whole
planets, the ending of all life of whole
systems.</p>

<p>"There is no need to keep the useless old
taboos that no longer fit into the present
world. But they should be ended by the
church itself, in its own time and its own
way, not abrogated by a contemptuous
politician."</p>

<p>She looked half-convinced, and he pressed
his point at once. "The power of the whole
planetary communications system is now
being used by Astrid Reine for the tracer
system now being built. With a word from
you the whole radio system will be at your
disposal for as long as we can keep it open.
You can at last tell the people of Onzar the
truth, which they have not heard for so
long."</p>

<p>Selan stared at the floor for a long time.
Finally she looked up. "I don't know. I
just don't know." She paused again, and it
was a long, agonizing pause for Thane.
"The decision is too large for me now. It
is a seizure of authority that goes against
my whole nature." She looked directly at
Thane. "But, be assured, you will have my
word in time. You and I will witness this
battle of the confluence, and then you will
know my decision."</p>

<p>Thane's mind was full of reasons why
the old priestess should not travel out into
space, with all the stresses of that travel, to
a position of great danger. But he met her
determined eyes and saw at once that all
arguments would be futile.</p>

<p>He got up to leave, and with the sincerest
of respect, lied to her. "Your decision will
be mine, Priestess Selan."</p>


<h2>VI</h2>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>he ship used by Selan in her trips
through the system was little larger than
the usual scout class but it had been completely
refitted for her purposes. She'd had
a special acceleration couch built in to allow
her to survive the stress of space travel. And
Thane noted that the large visiscreen would
be ideal for watching the battle. And the
communications system was larger than
usual. It might do for his purpose.</p>

<p>They stayed well back from the restricted
area where the whole Onzarian fleet was
orbited. On the screen images appeared&mdash;twenty-three
Class I cruisers, each with its
own fleet of cruiser escorts, scouts, disrupter
carriers, tenders and screen amplifiers.
Swarms of independent tactical squadrons.
Controlling all of them, ready to put them
into instant action, was the battle-control
cruiser, with its tracers, its receivers, its
computers, its nearly automatic message
center&mdash;and Candar and his staff.</p>

<p>Thane turned to the tracer that had been
installed. Selan was by his side. He switched
on its galactic screen. The Darzent marshalling
was now almost complete. A few
flashes of light still crossed the screen,
crossing countless light years at each jump,
pausing, and then a vault through more light
years. As Thane and Selan watched, the
flashes changed direction. The marshalling
was complete, and the assembled might of
Darzent was on its way. Thane found it hard
to believe that even the fleet waiting before
him could cope with all the force of Darzent.</p>

<p>The Darzent fleets had started from
points spanning the whole Galaxy. With
each flash of lights they converged, arrowing
toward the Onzarian Confluence. Thane
could imagine the watchers at similar screens
in each ship of the battle fleet. Eyes becoming,
grimmer, nervous smiles appearing and
disappearing on faces, hands clenching on
instruments. And the waiting.</p>

<p>The flashing lights approached closer.
The lead group of lights appeared, ten light
years from the tiny orange circle marking
the confluence. There was a pause&mdash;somewhat
less than a second&mdash;and the lights
appeared on the circle. Thane spun around
to the visiscreen. The lead battle squadron
of the Darzent Fleet had appeared there
simultaneously, surfaced in space. Seven of
the battle cruisers fired as one, and were
joined by all the firepower of their escort
ships.</p>

<p>The disrupter blasts, joining together,
created a blinding sun in empty space. It
was there. It was gone. And then just dead,
empty space again, but without the slightest
hint that the lead squadron of the mighty
Darzent Fleet had ever been there. Thane
quickly looked over at the galactic map to
see if they could have managed to get back
into warp-line drive. No, there were no
lights below the circle of the confluence.
But another light was approaching from
above, still ten light years away. Thane
turned back to the visiscreen just as the
second division of Onzar's fleet opened fire
on the surfacing Darzent forces. Again
utter annihilation.</p>

<p>The battle continued, with more surfacing
squadrons, more eruption, disappearing
suns. Thane turned away, losing interest in
the well-planned slaughter. Here, a parsec
away from the Onzar system, they were well
outside the intersystems communication jam.
Selan's horrified attention was still completely
on the battle. Thane stepped back
into the communications section of the scout
and flicked the powerful space set into life.
Static from the now almost constant disrupter
blasts ripped and crackled across the hum
of the set. There was just a chance, he considered,
that he could get the relay station
at Kadenar.</p>

<p>He worked rapidly, setting the frequency,
the directional beam, the gain control. It
was only a question of time before the detector
would pick up the clear beam on the
Onzar fleet, even in the midst of battle. At
last it came through.</p>

<p>Across space, the automatic code responder
finally could be heard. Thane gave his
own code and said, "A direct to Garth. Top
urgent."</p>

<p>"That code has been changed," the mechanical
voice replied at once. "Give current
code."</p>

<p>"But I've been out of touch," Thane
said, "and this must go through."</p>

<p>"That code has been changed," came the
same, unvarying reply. "Give current code."</p>

<p>It was no use. With the mechanical monitor
working he'd never get through. And of
course they would have changed his code,
after his disappearance and reported death.
He began to talk rapidly giving his instructions.
He couldn't get through to Garth, but
there was the chance that someone would
see the recording in time to act. Damn the
mechanical efficiency of Liaison!</p>

<p>Now Selan was all he had to depend on.
He started back to the forward compartment
hoping that Selan had at last made her
decision. The battle was still going on and
lights were still flashing down the galactic
screen to sudden, unwitting death. The bulk
of the Darzent fleet had been destroyed and
Thane saw that Candar had changed his
tactics. Now, instead of disrupters, he was
using concentrated, high-power Stoltz artillery.</p>

<p>After destroying the mass of their power,
Candar was going to bring in the staff ships,
with the fleet admirals as captives. It would
immobilize whatever power Darzent had in
reserve while Candar turned on the Allied
Systems. Already, confused and blinded
Darzent ships were drifting in space, with
Onzar wrecker tugs swarming in on them.</p>

<p>Thane turned to the old priestess Selan.
"Don't you see the crisis that is shaping?
Don't you see what Candar intends? When
this is done and he has re-powered, he'll
turn on the Allied Systems. They'll fight
back of course, but the war will make a
shambles of the whole Galaxy. Don't you
see?"</p>

<p>She turned slowly and looked at him.
Her eyes seemed older, much more tired
than they had before. "I have seen it, Roger
Thane, and this cannot be repeated. It will
not happen again. It is against all my training
and belief and the tenets of the faith,
but I, as Priestess of Keltar, will take it on
myself to attack the temporal power."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>hane felt the sweat on his hands, and
his smile was stiff though it was certainly
heartfelt. So much depended on this
woman's decision and on her performance
from now on. Without the aid of Liaison
to depend on it was up to this woman to
prevent galactic war.</p>

<p>They started back for Onzar II and Keltar
at once. They would have a good start on
Candar while he was engaged in mopping
up the Darzent fleet. Thane felt sure that
Candar would stay to confront the high-ranking
captives and to gloat over them.
On the other hand Candar would not delay
too long. He would be back to announce
his victory and to prepare for the attack on
the Allied Systems.</p>

<p>At the landing port outside Keltar,
Selan's automatic anti-grav was waiting. It
took them up over the outskirts of the bleak
wintry city and towards its center. As they
reached the solidly built-up area Thane
could see the dim outlines of the old city
wall beneath them. Not so many years ago,
as time went in the Galaxy, that wall had
been a vital protection against the spears of
the hill men. And now Onzarians were in
space, blasting away the power of a third
of the Galaxy. But still, the descendents of
the hill men, the descendents of the plains
dweller, the city builders, were living here,
underneath him.</p>

<p>In the midst of their technological revolution
they were still living in their ancient
superstitions. Still the old awe of the Word
of the matriarchal, matrilineal church. Still
the compulsion to have their little gold
symbols of rank sanctified and made real.
Still the.... Thane paused in his thoughts
as he saw flames leaping into the night sky
from a blast furnace, producing some of
the finest alloys in the Galaxy. It was still
the same, he hoped.</p>

<p>In another moment they were over the
towering white shaft of the communications
center. Then they slowly let down. Thane
thought that Candar's constant suspicion,
his unending compulsion for infinite control,
direct control, was playing into their hands
here. The communications center was exactly
that. It controlled all electronic communications
with the capitol system, and
could easily tie in with subject systems. But
how much time did they have? Thane didn't
know. With luck, they'd have a few vital
moments for the voice of the Holy Church
to go out over the planets.</p>

<p>The anti-grav settled gently on the upper
terrace. Thane helped Selan out into the
stinging cold of the Onzar night. Just inside
the gloomy passage to the grav-well a harsh
voice sounded. "Halt!"</p>

<p>They stopped. Thane made out a uniformed
man, his hand on his holster.</p>

<p>"We have come at the call of Astrid
Reine," Thane said. "She wishes our assistance."</p>

<p>"All who come for the thirteenth level
must have the code word. Give it and you
will pass."</p>

<p>Thane's right arm went up and the side
of his stiff hand flashed down, hitting the
sentry between his neck and shoulder. The
man's pistol was almost aimed at Thane
when Thane hit. The guard relaxed and
gently fell into an inert heap on the deck.
Thane bent and took the blaster from the
guard's inert fingers. He looked a moment
and found a Stoltz. He took that, too. He
straightened up and turned to Selan.
"Sorry," he said. "We can't risk an examination
now, and there's no time to lose. He'll
be all right." Thane picked up a hand-control
from the ledge in the sentry's cubicle
and led Selan to the well.</p>

<p>They dropped gently, interminably. At
last they reached "13." From the distance
they had dropped, Thane judged they were
far underground if this grav-well was timed
as most were. He held Selan's arm and
stopped their descent with his hand control.</p>

<p>They stepped out into a darkened corridor.
A sentry was waiting. There was no
'halt!' this time. Without a signal from the
roof they were automatically enemies. The
blast echoed along the corridor. In the dim
light the sentry's aim had not been good
but Thane felt the first sting in his right
arm. He aimed and fired the blaster with
his left hand, and thus solved the problem
of the sentry. They went down the corridor.</p>

<p>Thane pushed open the first lighted door
with his foot, his right arm hanging useless.
The blaster was ready in his left. Astrid
looked up, sitting at a table. She ran to him.</p>

<p>"Roger, you did make it. You can't know
how hard this waiting has been. I was sure
you would make it but I've gone through
days without hearing a thing."</p>

<p>He held her clumsily with his left arm,
the hand still gripping the blaster, and
winced when she pressed against his right
shoulder. "We've made it so far, Astrid,"
he said, "but the biggest job is still ahead.
How long can we keep the channels open
for a newscast?"</p>

<p>Astrid stepped back, puzzled. "As far as
the power goes, indefinitely, I believe. Of
course there haven't been any newscasts since
I've been here. All the power has been used
for the Tracer. But it's easy enough to switch
over. And all the other planet stations and
systems stations are primarily just amplifiers
and transmitters for this one."</p>

<p>"If the broadcasts haven't been on the
air, what about the receivers? Will anyone
be listening if we put a speech on?"</p>

<p>Astrid smiled. "We can take care of that.
Candar installed a system for use on his own
speeches. Each receiver automatically goes
on when he is speaking."</p>

<p>"That's it, then," Thane said. "Switch all
the power from the Tracer to the newscast
beam. Put the Priestess on the circuit and
I'll try to keep it open." He turned to Selan.
"How long will you need?"</p>

<p>"Ten minutes will be enough," she said
with determination.</p>

<p>"Let's make it fifteen to be sure," Thane
said. "I'll be on the roof doing what I can
to hold off whoever shows up. Meet me
there in fifteen minutes if everything is all
right, or come at once if anything at all
goes wrong."</p>

<p>Astrid noticed that he had been hurt.
"Your arm, Roger! What happened? Can
I do anything for it?" The deeply concerned
look in her eyes made him feel that he was
a little more to her than just a part of an
underground conspiracy.</p>

<p>"The arm's all right," he said. "A sentry
grazed it. I'll see you." He turned away and
started back for the roof.</p>


<h2>VII</h2>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>here was a throbbing ache in his arm
as he went back up the grav-well. He
held the control in his teeth and twisted it
with his left hand as he reached the roof
level. He stepped out. The cold had deepened
and the wind was bitter. He stepped
over the unconscious sentry and placed his
guns on the ledge before him. He twisted
the dial of the Stoltz to 'lethal' and to 'max
area.' With that sort of adjustment the
Stoltz was dependable only for very short
ranges, but he had to have something ready
against a mass attack. The blaster was a
precision, aimed weapon, and would do
for one at a time.</p>

<p>The cold soaked in. His arm numbed and
then ached, and numbed again. Thane
waited. He had no way of knowing what
Selan was saying or what effect it had in
the minds of the Onzarians. Or did he?
The normal street noises below seemed to
be changing. Through the noise of the wind,
a dull, confused murmur came up from
below. That might be mass anger.</p>

<p>Thane picked up the blaster and walked
over to the parapet. Far below he could see
that crowds were beginning to gather in the
street. Some were clumped around street
loudspeakers.</p>

<p>There was a hum overhead. Thane spun
around and looked up. A police patrol was
just overhead. As it settled Thane threw
himself flat on the icy tile. There was an
immediate shrieking pain from his injured
right arm. He gritted his teeth and aimed
as the door of the anti-grav opened. The
flash of his blaster was a bright orange in
the night air. The man on his side crumpled.
Thane was on his feet at once and
dashed to the door of the patrol. One more
flash of the blaster and the other occupant
tumbled out the other side.</p>

<p>Thane hurried back to the sentry booth
for his Stoltz. There would be more. As he
reached it something hit him hard. He fell
back towards the patrol anti-grav. He was
fighting desperately. A hand went around
his throat and tightened. A knee came down
on his right arm. He wavered on the brink
of unconsciousness. He fought his way back.</p>

<p>He jabbed savagely with the stiff fingers
of his left hand and caught his opponent
under the jaw. Thane pushed upward and
back as hard as he could. Thane felt the
hand loosen on his throat. Thane came up as
the man went back. As they both reached
their feet Thane saw it was the sentry. They
struggled for a moment on the edge of the
parapet. Then the sentry made a last grasp
at Thane and went over.</p>

<p>Thane felt the sweat condense and freeze
under his clothes as he searched for his lost
blaster. He found it and started back for the
entryway. Three more police ships were
coming towards the roof. At that moment
the grav-well door slid open and Astrid
and Selan stood before him.</p>

<p>The first police ship fired before it
landed. The blast came before Thane had
reached Astrid and Selan. He saw Selan
crumple. She was dead when he touched
her. He had the impulse to do something,
to say something, for one who had forced
herself to do so much. But there was no
time. He thrust the blaster at Astrid, who
was still staring at the dead Selan. "I'll try
to get them with the Stoltz. You hit anything
that's dangerous with this!" He
grasped the Stoltz from the ledge and
stepped forward. Running figures were coming
towards them now. He waited with a
weary sort of calm for them to come close
enough. An explosion burst the tile just off
his right heel. He waited. Finally he pressed
the impeller of the Stoltz. The wide-angle
shot dissipated the power, but it did include
all of them. They kept coming forward. One
of them raised an arm and there was a
blinding flash. Thane firmly pressed the impeller
again as he fell forward.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>here was a voice, and Thane tried to
get ready for what was coming but it
was too much effort. Anyway, the voice
went away. And then someone else was
there, and someone else was saying something
important, if he could only catch it
... and then movement, up, and around,
and down.</p>

<p>When Thane finally opened his eyes
Garth was standing over him biting his
cigar. "They tell me you've committed treason,"
Garth said.</p>

<p>Thane looked up at him steadily. "I guess
that's right," he said.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know what we're going to
do."</p>

<p>"I suppose so...." and Thane stopped.
Full memory was coming back, and all its
implications. "Wait ... it's all wrong. What
are you doing here? And where is here? And
... if you're here&mdash;if we're together, then
it must have worked! It must have worked!"</p>

<p>Garth lit his cigar. His face changed
slightly. It might have been a smile. "Yes.
It worked. The old girl really hit the Onzarians.
They hadn't heard any news at all
in all the days of radio silence. Then their
sets came on and there she was telling them
that all their gold gimmicks were no good
any more. That death was approaching for
all of Onzar. That Candar had ... well,
you can hear the recording of it. She meant
every word and they acted as if they believed
every word. Of course, they'd been conditioned
to that with the propaganda newscasts.
But after the long silence she really hit
them."</p>

<p>Some one moved at Thane's other side.
He turned his head. It was Astrid. She was
scowling at Garth. "You're a mean, bitter
old bureaucrat," she said mockingly, "talking
to Roger like that."</p>

<p>Garth's face twisted into the approximation
of a grin. "Well, there actually were
treason charges against him for a time. But
I will say that things have changed."</p>

<p>Thane looked from one to another and
then overhead. What he could see of the
room looked vaguely familiar, but....
"Where are we?"</p>

<p>"At the space station," Astrid said. "Dad
and Garth are working over a treaty between
Onzar and the Allied Systems."</p>

<p>"Dad? Then Dr. Reine was rescued? But
how?"</p>

<p>They both started talking. A moment
later Manning Reine joined them, looking
paler and more haggard than before. All
three of them talked, constantly interrupting
each other. Gradually Thane got the essential
details.</p>

<p>After the first impulsive, unorganized revolt,
the church took over. It, at least, had
an organization. A large part of the armed
forces had joined in. Some, though, had
stayed on Candar's side, and there had been
sharp, bitter fighting. But by the time Candar
landed it was about over. This was his
greatest victory. He had destroyed the power
of Darzent, and was bringing back, as captives,
most of the leadership of the fleet and
of Darzent. In addition, there was Dr.
Reine, who had been discovered in captivity,
on the leading staff ship. But when Candar
stepped out into the spaceport, instead of
meeting his adulating subjects, a very determined
group of his own soldiers stopped
him.</p>

<p>Thane finally turned to Astrid. "But how
did we get away? The last I remember...."</p>

<p>"You got them all, Roger. One of them
hit your leg with a blaster as he went down.
All I had to do was to get you to the anti-grav,
and out of there."</p>

<p>Thane moved the leg, experimentally, and
winced. "How is it?"</p>

<p>"Surface burn and shock," Astrid said.
"In a week you can ski on it."</p>

<p>"Skiing&mdash;haven't done that since I was
at Earth University." He thought for a
moment. "How did you get into it, Garth?
Did my message get through to Liaison?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. We picked up the recording an
hour or so after it was recorded. I listened to
it myself, and it convinced me. It sounded
like you, and I could sort of see what you
might have done. I shoved every available
Liaison in the adjacent sectors right into Onzar,
on my own responsibility. It worked
out as it turned out. All they had to do
was to clean up the tag-end of things."</p>
